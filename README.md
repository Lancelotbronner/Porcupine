# Porcupine

This is mostly a sandbox for me to experiment with a 2D tile-based engine inspired by games like Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress or Clanfolk.

## Roadmap

Forcing a better statistical analysis of what my abstractions will require, I want to implement and render loose items. Then I want to implement simple entities which can wander around the land.

With that I want to move to an entity component system architecture. In this particular case the chunk is the entity and the systems will be the generator, renderer, serializer and deserializer.

At this point I'll reconsider the roadmap.
